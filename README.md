- 👋 Hi, I’m @taylorbolinger
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack Software Engineering and Design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of front end and back end development. I enjoy completing projects and watching ideas come to fruition. I find the development process to be so interesting, fun, and incredibly enjoyable.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that expand my knowledge and skills in both front end and back end development.
